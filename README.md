# Project-1
This repository contains the code required for Project 1 of the machine learning course. 
There are 4 different python programs whose functions are as follows:

-The file OLS.py performs ordinary least square fitting on the Franke function both with and without resampling methods (bootstrap and cross validation)

-The file Ridge.py performs fitting using the Ridge method on the Franke function both with and without resampling methods (bootstrap and cross validation)

-The file Lasso.py performs fitting using the Lasso method on the Franke function both with and without resampling methods (cross validation)

-The file Terrain analysis.py analysis the terrain data using OLS and Ridge. The resampling methods used are Bootstrap (for OLS) and cross validation (for Ridge). Lasso is also implemented in this code, but however it is found that this section of the code requires very long run times.
